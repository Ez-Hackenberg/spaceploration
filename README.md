spaceploration.com is an interactive educational website for teachers and students made to incorporate aspects of astronomy into scinece classrooms with the aid of fun games!

Because astronomy is not a requirement in many science curriculums, spaceploration.com serves as a portal into space. We have designed two mini-games for the site, but in the future we envision spaceploration.com serving as an opensource platform where people can contribute their own games or suggest games that use datasets from the American Natural History Museum. Future games will have different difficulty levels based on people's respective knowledge of astronomy so that it serves as diverse a population as possible.
